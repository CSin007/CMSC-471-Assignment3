## ✏️ Black Hat Visualization Explanation

This chart was purposely designed to mislead viewers by taking advantage of how people usually read data. It does this in three main ways: through the title and labels, by changing how the data is presented, and through the way it’s visually designed.

### 1. Titles and Labels

The title, **“Total Complained By Year have Reduced,”** is already doing a lot of work to push a certain idea. It’s not even grammatically correct, which kind of throws you off, but it still makes it sound like complaints have clearly gone down. There’s no actual explanation or proof in the chart for why that’s true—it’s just suggested in the title. On top of that, using green for the title text makes it feel like this is a good thing, which subtly tells the viewer how to feel about the data before they’ve really looked at it.

### 2. Data Transformation

The way the data is transformed is also super misleading. I left out any complaints that were filed after 2019, even though I’m pretty sure there’s data for those years. That makes it look like complaints just stopped coming in, which isn’t true. I also cut off all the years before 2000, which hides any historical trends that might change how you interpret the rest. The result is a much cleaner-looking decline, but it’s not the full story.

### 3. Marks and Encodings

Visually, the chart is set up to make it seem like complaints are dropping. I reversed the x-axis, so the most recent years are on the left and it moves backwards in time as you go right. Most people expect charts to move forward in time from left to right, so flipping it plays a trick on your brain. It makes it seem like things are getting better, when really it’s just a layout trick.

If I really wanted to take it further, I could have messed with the bar widths, changed the scale on the y-axis, or added a fake note about reforms explaining the drop. But even without that, this chart already does a good job of showing how small design choices can really change how people understand data.
